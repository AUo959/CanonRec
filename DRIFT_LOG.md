# DRIFT_LOG

## Drift Entry — 2026-06-10
- **Source:** ORION_STATION_CANONICAL_STAFF_REGISTRY.json (v2.4.1, 2025-07-13) reconciled against L1_ENTITY_LEDGER (2026-03-08) during the CanonRec thaw
- **Type:** conflicting role (registry-era titles vs ledger canon)
- **Entities affected:** Amira Sato, Jiro Tanaka, Maya Shepard
- **Description:** The recovered command registry predates the ledger; four seat titles differ:
  - Maya Shepard: registry `Deputy Commander` (station_command/deputy_commander) vs ledger `Executive Officer (XO)`
  - Maya Shepard: registry `FleetOps Commander` (department_heads/fleet_operations) vs ledger `Executive Officer (XO)`
  - Amira Sato: registry `Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer` (department_heads/chief_ethics_officer) vs ledger `Chief Ethics Officer`
  - Jiro Tanaka: registry `Chief Systems Engineer` (department_heads/chief_systems_engineer) vs ledger `Chief Engineering Officer`
- **Resolution:** Defer to ledger (newer, source-prioritized; these exact variants were already
  recorded in the ledger's legacy-drift traces). Registry titles preserved per-entity as
  "Legacy Role Aliases". No canon change required.

## Drift Entry — 2026-06-11
- **Source:** Owner definitional ruling (user-role nomenclature)
- **Type:** conflicting role (legacy alias)
- **Entities affected:** Pilot (user role), Aurora (addressing), mesh runtime defaults
- **Description:** Early conversations and the March mesh runtime used
  "Captain" for the human user; the owner rules the canonical user-interface
  role is **Pilot**. Thorne commands Orion Station — the user does not hold
  a command seat.
- **Resolution:** Canon record `canon/L1/station/PILOT_ROLE_DEFINITION.md`
  created (CANON). Historical transcripts and channel ids keep "captain"
  verbatim as legacy alias; runtime defaults move to Pilot with
  back-compatible alias routing.
